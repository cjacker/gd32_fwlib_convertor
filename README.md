# gd32F/E/C/W/L Firmware Library convertor

A script to convert GD32F/E/C/L/W  official firmware library to gcc and makefile project

usage:

```
./gd32_fwlib_convertor <official firmware library rar or zip>
```

it's not good, there is still a lot of work need to do manually after converted, but works.

**NOTE:** This script not works with gd32vf103 risc-v firmware library, it's already gcc ready.

Here is the [pre-converted gd32vf103 firmware library](https://github.com/cjacker/gd32vf103_firmware_library_gcc_makefile).
