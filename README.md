# gd32F/E/C/W/L Firmware Library convertor

A script to convert GD32F/E/C/L/W  official firmware library to gcc and makefile project

usage:

```
./gd32_fwlib_convertor <official firmware library rar or zip>
```

it's not good, there is still a lot of work need to do manually after converted, but works.
